-Custom Golden Days/Beta styled conversion/parity assets/fixes for mods

SUPER IMPORTANT NOTE: Also... 

-Removed ProgrammerArt/NostalgicTweaks flashy/unnecessary connotations in the menus (@ en_us.json: "resourcePack.title" & "options.title")
-Fixed mobs playing the OOF sound (restricted to the player only)
-Replaced "icons.png" (identical as before, but changes food icons to hearts to ensure food tooltips represents correct healing!)
-Updated end_portal_frame_filled.json block model in order to match End Remastered's filled eye size. 8x8 instead of 6x6.
-Deleted 4 original bucket textures, as Programmer Art fixes them
-Added oak hanging sign textures
-Added overrides for all slim skins to use Alex's original texture
-Added overrides for all wide skins to use Steve's original texture

(these are the ONLY edits to any original files - anything else is strictly additions)
