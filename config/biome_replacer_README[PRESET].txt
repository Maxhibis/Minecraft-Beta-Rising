# By default, Beta Rising is setup where all non-"Modern Beta" worldtypes are unchanged, and the same as vanilla. This means with all the options available, you can play Beta Rising up through basically every MC version's worldgen up to 1.20.1!
# 
# Use the alternative config file instead, if you want to try a customized hybrid preset for "Default" worldtype(s).
# -It is essentially a new worldtype
# -It should feel pretty similar to Beta worlds, just with all the STUFF that is 1.20.1 worldgen.
# 
# Instructions for idiots: rename/replace "biome_replacer.properties[PRESET]" to "biome_replacer.properties"... I'd recommend making a copy of the original in case you want to switch back.
